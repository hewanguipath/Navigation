# Project 1: Navigation

### Introduction

For this project, I will train an agent to navigate (and collect bananas!) in a large, square world.  

![Trained Agent][image1]

A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana.  Thus, the goal of your agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.  

The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around agent's forward direction.  Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions.  Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:
- **`0`** - move forward.
- **`1`** - move backward.
- **`2`** - turn left.
- **`3`** - turn right.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

### Getting Started

1. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:
    - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux.zip)
    - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana.app.zip)
    - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86.zip)
    - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86_64.zip)
    
    (_For Windows users_) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

    (_For AWS_) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux_NoVis.zip) to obtain the environment.

2. Place the file in the DRLND GitHub repository, in the `p1_navigation/` folder, and unzip (or decompress) the file. 

### Implementations

1. Define the Deep Q-Network:
    - As we had observed the Vector Observation space size in this enviroment is 37
    - First hiden layer units as 64 and 2nd hiden layer as 16, small enough to run in cpu
    - Relu is a better choice in this senario, as we need the values diverse enough to make the choice of actions.

2. Define the Replay Buffer:
    - Make a deque for memorizing episode
    - Each step of episode will be saved in the buffer
    
3. Define the Agent:
    - Since DQN is off-policy learning, I need to define 2 Deep Q-Networks: local and target, the local network will used for the current policy, and the target network will be used as updating the better policy

4. Train the DQN:
    - Epsilon starts from 1 and times 0.97 as decay, this will make it down to 0.002 around 200 episode
    - The navigations goes 300 - 1000 steps, so make the minimum epsilon as 0.0005 gets very good result at first 300 episodes
    - The model reach average score as 13 around 200 episodes, and 15 in 404 episodes
